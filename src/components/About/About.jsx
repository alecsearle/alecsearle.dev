          I am a Senior Software Engineering student at Utah Tech University with a strong passion
          for utilizing technology to bring innovative ideas and solutions to life. My professional
          experience includes WordPress web development and currently leading a team of Integrated
          Software Vendor Support Specialists, which has strengthened both my technical skills and
          leadership abilities. I have a growing interest in mobile development and cross-platform
          applications, and I'm driven by the opportunity to solve complex problems and create
          technology that makes a meaningful impact across web and mobile platforms.
